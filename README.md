# NeuroWave - Parkinson's Detection Application

## Overview

NeuroWave is a revolutionary mobile application made on flutter designed exclusively for healthcare professionals to assist in the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). By analyzing simple drawings such as spirals and waves, NeuroWave leverages state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's with a confidence score. The app is built using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and employs the VGG16 model to process and analyze input data.

## Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson’s Disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that impacts movement, speech, thinking, behavior, and vital functions. The symptoms of Parkinson's are categorized into motor symptoms, such as tremors and bradykinesia, and non-motor symptoms, including depression, cognitive changes, sleep disorders, and speech impairments. Early detection is crucial for managing and mitigating the progression of this incurable disease, which presents unique challenges for healthcare professionals.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Patients can draw spirals or waves on the screen using a stylus.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes the VGG16 model via TFLite to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease.
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence score for each prediction to help in clinical decision-making.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Employs feature extraction techniques to identify hidden patterns associated with different phases of Parkinson's Disease.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: The patient draws a spiral or wave on the device's screen using a stylus.
2. **Data Processing**: The app processes the drawing using the VGG16 model implemented in TensorFlow Lite.
3. **Prediction**: The model analyzes the drawing to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease.
4. **Confidence Score**: The app displays the prediction along with a confidence score, indicating the model's certainty.
